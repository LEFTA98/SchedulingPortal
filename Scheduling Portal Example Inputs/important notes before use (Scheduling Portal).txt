To setup:
- Attach the RotmanParticipant table (in your local SQL Express instance)
- The web.config used for local testing should be "Web_backup"

Before publishing:
replace the current "web.config" with the web.config to be used for the Rotman webserver ("Web_real")

Publish path: (should be the default)
\\fmgmt-02.rotman.utoronto.ca\bonham\lab


Go to SQL database
delete from userdata where UserTypeID = 3
delete from MemberRoles
-check times table is populated

Saved file: in the same folder as published folder path



Two required CSV Files:
User List

* the two csv files must contain columns in the specified order
* school name in both "User List" and "Student List" files must match EXACTLY
* no accents or commas allowed in the school name or student name

* admin username: admin
* admin password: frtl

Note:
To change the case names, go to file "Scheduling.aspx.cs" and change the variables
To change the quant or algo case names, go to the .aspx file directly and change as appropriate
// these are the case names!
        public string Day1MorningCase = "BP Commodities";
         public string Day1AfternoonCase = "Volatility Trading";
         public string Day2MorningCase = "S&P Global Credit Risk";
         public string Day2AfternoonCase = "Flow Traders ETF";

// These are the shorthand notations for the output schedule csv files
        public static string d1am = "BP";
        public static string d1pm = "VT";
        public static string d2am = "CR";
        public static string d2pm = "ETF";



* the BP/Algo times list has already been uploaded
* the order that the schools are listed in "2016UserList.csv" determines whether they're in BP heat 1 or BP heat 2
